                <p class = "text-left">Some people would say that Admiral Grace Hopper came from humble beginnings, with little background in math or science, to become an overnight sensation.  Those people would also be completely full of baloney.  It was clear from age seven, when she took apart over half a dozen alarm clocks in a pique of curiousity, that Grace Hopper was born to investigate, tinker with all of electronic creation, and generally kick butt at all things technological.
                </p>
                <p class = "text-left">Hopper would go on to complete a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Vassar in 1928.  When her sometime mentor, Oyestein Ore, bet her $100 that she couldn't complete a PhD from Yale, she nabbed that degree in 1934, gleefully took his money and told him where he could stick it.**  She spent the next 8 years spreading her mathematical knowledge to all who had the guts and determination to enter her classroom.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p class = "text-right">** This bet, and ensuing remarks, probably didn't really happen.</p>

            <div class = "col-md-8">
                <p class = "text-right">In 1941, Hopper decided she wasn't about sit around comfortably at Vassar while her country was under attack.  The Navy told her that she was too underweight to be allowed in their boys' club, but she ignored all that mish-mash and joined up anyway.  Unsurprisingly, she graduated first in her class at officer's school, and published three papers on the Mark I computer, the first of its kind.  Vassar begged and pleaded with her to come back at the end of the war, but Hopper had too much awesome left to give.
                </p>
                <p class = "text-right">In 1949, Hopper took one look at the UNIVAC, and said to herself "I want to get in on some of that."  While plugging away, Hopper was hit with a bolt of inspiration, deciding "You know what, these ones and zeros are okay and all, but wouldn't it be nice if we could use the 26 English letters instead?"  The entire chain of command told her that she'd lost the plot, but predictably she ignored the lot of them and completed the world's first compiler in 1952.  The old guard was properly gobsmacked.</p>

            <div class ="col-md-8">
                <p class = "text-left">The 1960's quickly became the new wild west, as every two-bit snake oil salesman with a computer tried to create their own computer language, and claimed it was the new state of the art.  Hopper laid down the law on that mess with a vengeance.  She rounded the varmints up and disillusioned them of all pertinent illusions, and as the new sheriff in town, she was going to lay down some serious standards and practices for the world's programming languages.  Just to get all of them started, she designed a new business language that followed all of said standards, known as COBOL, since the actual name is too long to pronounce.  The world's businesses ate it up and asked for seconds.</p>
                <p class = "text-left">In 1966, the navy told her that at age 60, her time on the strength had come to a close.  She looked retirement in the face, decided that she didn't like the looks of it, ignored them all, and got straight back to work.  It took them nearly 20 years to convince her to leave the office for good.</p>

            <div class ="col-md-8">
                <p class = "text-right">Hopper would spend the remainder of her life as a goodwill ambassador, telling all and sundry of the days of yore, when computers were dinosaurs and the programmers slept with one eye open to avoid getting swallowed by the cable beasts.  Her greatest legacy will always be her willingness to take chances, and her undying technological daredevilry, which she heartily encouraged in all of her young students.</p>
                <p class = "text-right">In Hopper's own words: <em>"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances."</em></p>
                <p class = "text-right">Thank you for everything, Grace Hopper.</p>
